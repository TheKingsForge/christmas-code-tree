# christmas-code-tree

## Summary

- Christmas is special because it is the time of year to reflect on the humble beginnings of Jesus Christ: See Luke 2: 1-20. I was contemplating fun ways to decorate my desk for Christmas as a programmer. C++ ignores whitespace when compiling so I thought it would be the perfect language to make some festive art while illustrating that capability.

## Compiling on Linux

1. Clone the repo using `git clone <repoLink>`.
2. Navigate to the project directory using `cd`.
3. Compile using `g++ tree.cpp`.
4. Run program using `./a.out`.
