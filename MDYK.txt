Mary, did you know
That your baby boy
Would one day walk on water?
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy
Would save our sons and daughters?
Did you know
That your baby boy
Has come to make you new?
This Child that you delivered
Will soon deliver you.
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy
Will give sight to the blind man?
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy
Would calm a storm with His hand?
Did you know
That your baby boy
Has walked where angels trod?
And when you kiss your little baby
You've kissed the face of God?
Mary, did you know?
Oo, Mary, did you know?
The blind will see
The deaf will hear;
The dead will live again!
The lame will leap
The dumb will speak
The praises of the Lamb!
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy
Is the Lord of all creation?
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy
Will one day rule the nations?
Did you know
That your baby boy
Was heaven's perfect Lamb?
And the sleeping Child you're holdin'
Is the Great I Am!
